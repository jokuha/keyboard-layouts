# Keyboard layouts for macOS

These are modified keyboard layouts, mostly to provide easy access to German
umlauts and the 'sz'.

'ABC Extended JK' moved the active " and ¯ accents to OPT-y and OPT-d and then
makes OPT-a,o,u print ä, ö, ü (also for shifted/uppercase variants).

Created using [Ukelele](https://software.sil.org/ukelele).
