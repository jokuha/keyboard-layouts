# Keyboard layouts for macOS

These are modified keyboard layouts, mostly to provide easy access to German umlauts and the 'sz'.

`JK ABC Extended` has `OPT-a`, `o`, `u` print `ä`, `ö`, `ü` (also for shifted/uppercase variants)
and has the active `"` and `¯` accents on `OPT-y` and `OPT-d`, respectively. It also has `€` on
`OPT-e`.

`JK ABC` has similar upgrades but more greek characters, math symbols, and some graphical characters
at the cost of less active accents.

## Installation

Download the dmg image of the [latest
release](https://github.com/jokuha/keyboard-layouts/releases/latest) and run the contained
installer.

Alternatively, you can download the source and copy any or all of the the `.bundle`s to
`~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/` (single user) or `/Library/Keyboard Layouts/` (all users).
