# Keyboard layouts for macOS

These are modified keyboard layouts, mostly to provide easy access to German
umlauts and the 'sz'.

'ABC Extended JK' has `OPT-a`, `o`, `u` print `ä`, `ö`, `ü` (also for
shifted/uppercase variants) and has the active `"` and `¯` accents on `OPT-y`
and `OPT-d`, respectively. It also has `€` on `OPT-e`.


## Installation

Download the dmg image of the [latest
release](https://github.com/jokuha/keyboard-layouts/releases/latest) and run the
contained installer.

Alternatively, you can download the source and copy the `.bundle` to
`~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/` (single user) or `/Library/Keyboard Layouts/` (all
users).
